## Description

This project is part of the 2024 Estimation & Classification course at Instituto Superior Técnico (IST) in Lisboa. It demonstrates how to perform localization of a robot in a 2D gridworld using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). 

## Features:
- Random generation and simulation of partially observable gridworlds implemented with [Farama's Gym Environment](https://gymnasium.farama.org/).
- Localization of a robot navigating the environment using HMMs.
- Visualization of global state and local observations with and state probability distribution .
